# DofusProtocol
c# lib of the dofus protocol


This the Dofus communication protocol extracted by the AAmaknaCore-ProtocolBuilder.
(original  https://github.com/alexandre10044/AmaknaCore-ProtocolBuilder)
The version used to generate this is the following fork : https://github.com/ImNotARobot742/AmaknaCore-ProtocolBuilder

Once a merge is made the nuget package is published to nuget.org. (https://www.nuget.org/packages/DofusProtocol/)
And a release containing everything is made (I will take care of this ... maybe :p ). 

All this is against Ankama CGU, beware.
Still hope it helps.
